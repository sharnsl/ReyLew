Death Across the Gender and Racial Divides
Team ReyLew on Death Across the Gender and Racial Divides
Executive Summary
Sharnette and Dominique’s project will take a closer look at suicides, homicides, and accidental opioid deaths and how they affect males and females of different ethnicities in the United States. We will determine if there is a correlation between each cause of death and gender and if there is a correlation between each cause of death and ethnicity.
Business Objectives
To showcase the skills that Sharnette and Dominique have acquired through the Data Science program. We will be using R and Tableau to wrangle, analyze, and visualize the “Guns” dataset and the “Opioid Deaths” dataset made available on Kaggle.
At the conclusion of the project, Sharnette and Dominique will explain our work in layman’s term, and will present our findings to the students, faculty, staff, and potential employers, along with other interested parties via an internet video service.
Background
Sharnette and Dominique have chosen the “Guns” and “Opioid Deaths” datasets because we are both interested in reviewing gender and racial disparities in an effort to understand the severity so that we may begin to discussions on working to close the gap. We hope to gain insight from the data to show that there are such disparities and to further a dialogue about strategies for an intersectional approach to viable and long-lasting solutions.  
Scope
Sharnette and Dominique will be using the software taught in the program to complete the project. We will be intentional on using tools of our interest or tools that may aid finding a job.
Functional requirements
Data Wrangling: The downloaded datasets will be successfully cleaned up for analyzing. We will combine both datasets into one dataset, remove redundant or non-useful columns, delete non valued rows or “N/As”.
Data Analysis: Sharnette and Dominique will familiarize ourselves with the dataset. We will establish what each column means, and how the values are measured. We will brainstorm on questions to ask, and what we might gather from the dataset. Then, we will identify the proper functions to create predictions.
Data Visualization: Once Sharnette and Dominique have a comprehensive understanding and gathered insight from the datasets, we will work on visualizing the findings. We will use Tableau and compile the visuals and texts in a Power Point presentation.
Presentation: Working with Dr. Meredith Dodd, Sharnette and Dominique will schedule a time to present their findings. 
Personnel requirements
Sharnette and Dominique are the two developers. We will need to work closely for this project to succeed. We will touch base once a day via email or Slack to problem-solve or to check in on work progresses. Once a week, we will review the past week workload and plan out the next week. We will take turns being the scrum master and report our progress to our instructor. 
Once a week, we will meet with our instructor, Dr. Meredith Dodd
We may also consult with our coding mentor, Devin Moya.
Delivery schedule
Week 1: Import dataset into R to begin data wrangling. Any unnecessary columns will be removed. We will educate ourselves on gun deaths and opioid use. Set up Github.
Week 2: Study the dataset and ask questions. Review the possible correlations of ethnicity and death. Review the possible correlations between gender and death. Complete basic statistical analysis, such as means, and distribution of each ethnicity and gender.
Week 3: Optimization and Visualization 
Week 4: Review and validate findings from the previous week and draw insights/conclusions.
Week 5: Compile findings into a Power Point presentation. Review it with our instructor and family members to ensure that the presentation is clear and logical. Be sure the presentation is engaging and visual pleasing. 
Week 6: Make final touches to the Power Point presentation. Sharnette and Dominique will create a script, divide the presentation equally and practice it with our instructor. 
Other requirements
No other requirements will be needed beyond the free services of Trello, R and Tableau
Assumptions
Sharnette and Dominique will be using the latest versions of R and Tableau
Limitations
If Sharnette and Dominique fail to stay on schedule due to outside influence the project may be delayed.
Risks
Numerous risks may arise such as natural disasters, power outages, family emergencies, illness, or broken software/hardware. Sharnette and Dominique will work together to mitigate any of these risks and redistribute the workload if necessary, if such a problem should present itself. The risk of this project being incomplete is minimal. We will be successful in completing this project!
